# BookHubApp

    BookHubApp is a mobile application moving us from a stationary library to a mobile world. The project was created with college friends for course credit.

 ## Function

    A person who is not logged in can only browse through the available library resources, while a person who is logged in addition has the possibility to
    * borrow books
    * books reservations
    * extension of rental period
    * cancellation of book reservation
    
## Technical

    It has the necessary functionality to borrow and reserve a book. It uses the public API found at the [link](https://puz-biblioteka.herokuapp.com/). We used the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural model.
